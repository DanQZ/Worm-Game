Alpha 1.1
  -Incrased height of second obstacle to make it so that you can't just accidentally throw yourself over it 

Alpha 1.0.2
  -Fixed flexing one side coloring both sides red
  -Experimental physics fix by enabling "max distance only" on the distance joints  

Alpha 1.0.1 - UI fix 
  -UI now scales properly with resolution

Alpha 1.0 - Initial release
  -Worm updates 
    -Can now curl both ends individually, from the middle 
    -Can now flex entire body straight, or flex just one end straight
    -Much faster turn speed, reduced max torque (fixes buggy physics issues)
  -Made initial map, with 3 different areas 
  -Added basic UI (timer and a close game button)

Prototype
  -Worm with ability to curl up in 2 directions and add friction to either end
  -map in progress, 3 obstacles (single square, ramp, 3 square staircase)
